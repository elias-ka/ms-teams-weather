# ms-teams-weather
Microsoft Teams bot that fetches the current weather for a specified city and country.
Done as a part of a Cloud Services course at Oulu University of Applied Sciences.

 It handles incoming requests to fetch weather data for a specified city and country.
 The bot verifies the request signature, parses the city and country from the request payload,
 fetches the weather data, and returns a forecast message as a response back to the user.

## Example usage
To use the bot, you need to deploy it using the instructions below.
After that, you can use the bot by mentioning it in a channel and providing the city and country you want to get the weather for.

For example:
> @Weather Helsinki, FI
>
>The current weather in Helsinki, FI is characterized by few clouds, with a temperature of -10.1Â°C. The humidity level is 79%, and the wind speed is 5.4 m/s. The sun will rise at 08:22 AM and set at 04:46 PM local time.

## Deployment
To deploy the bot, you need to have a [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) account, an [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API key, and a [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) team where you have the necessary permissions to install apps.

After you have met the prerequisites, you can deploy the bot by following these steps:

Clone the repository:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:elias-ka/ms-teams-weather.git
$ cd ms-teams-weather
```

Install dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

Set the OpenWeatherMap API key in CloudFlare secrets:
```bash
$ npx wrangler secret put OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY
```

Deploy the bot to CloudFlare and follow the instructions:
```bash
$ npm run deploy
```

Go to your Microsoft Teams team and go to ``Manage Team -> Apps -> Create an outgoing webhook`` and set the following values:
- Name: Weather
- Callback URL: https://\<your-worker-name\>.workers.dev/weather
- Description: Get the current weather at a city. Example: @Weather Helsinki, FI
- Optionally, you can set a profile picture for the bot.

After you've created the webhook, copy the HMAC token from the dialogue and set it as a secret in CloudFlare:
```bash
$ npx wrangler secret put MS_TEAMS_SECRET
```

Finally, redeploy the bot to CloudFlare:
```bash
$ npm run deploy
```
